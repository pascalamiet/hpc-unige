# hpc-unige

Personal reference docs for the [UNIGE HPC clusters](https://doc.eresearch.unige.ch/hpc/start) — because reading 200 pages of official documentation every time you forget an rsync flag is not a good use of your one life.

**guides/** contains polished, generic instructions that should work for any UNIGE HPC user. They don't include personal usernames or paths — those belong in your own local notes.

**skills/** holds LLM skill scripts that make common HPC tasks interactive — generating job scripts, finding modules, tuning resources. See [🤖 LLM skills](#-llm-skills) below.

**sync/** is a small shell tool that registers a local project folder for one-command rsync syncing to the cluster. See [📂 Syncing projects](#-syncing-projects) below.

**wiki/** is an [LM-maintained knowledge base](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) (as introduced by Andrej Karpathy) synthesized from the official UNIGE HPC documentation. It's meant to be queried and extended incrementally, not read cover to cover. Having it around will increase the accuracy of responses you get from LLMs, you don't have to read what is in it yourself.

## 🚀 Getting started

If you're new to the clusters, read these in order:

1. [SSH setup](guides/ssh.md) — how to connect, set up SSH keys, configure aliases, and not get locked out by fail2ban
2. [File transfer](guides/file-transfer.md) — scp, rsync, sftp, and how to move data between clusters without routing everything through your laptop
3. [Running jobs (Slurm)](guides/slurm-jobs.md) — how to actually run computations: `sbatch`, `srun`, `salloc`, picking a partition, sizing resources, monitoring jobs

Then browse the wiki for deeper dives:

| Topic | Page |
|-------|------|
| Cluster overview & architecture | [wiki/\_wiki\_/overview.md](wiki/_wiki_/overview.md) |
| Slurm job submission | [wiki/\_wiki\_/slurm.md](wiki/_wiki_/slurm.md) |
| Storage tiers & quotas | [wiki/\_wiki\_/storage.md](wiki/_wiki_/storage.md) |
| Loading software (modules, conda, containers) | [wiki/\_wiki\_/software-modules.md](wiki/_wiki_/software-modules.md) |
| Billing & accounting | [wiki/\_wiki\_/cost-and-accounting.md](wiki/_wiki_/cost-and-accounting.md) |
| Best practices (don't be that person on the login node) | [wiki/\_wiki\_/best-practices.md](wiki/_wiki_/best-practices.md) |

## 🖥️ The three clusters

UNIGE runs three separate HPC clusters. They do **not** share storage — pick one and stay there.

| Cluster | Location | Public GPUs | Good for |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Baobab** | Uni Dufour | None (private only) | CPU jobs, teaching, OpenOnDemand |
| **Yggdrasil** | Astro/Sauverny | Yes (V100, Titan RTX) | GPU jobs, astrophysics |
| **Bamboo** | Campus Biotech | Yes (H100, H200, RTX 5090) | Modern GPU workloads |

All three use Slurm for job scheduling and BeeGFS for shared storage.

---

## ⚡ The five things you must not forget

1. **Never run compute jobs on the login node.** Use `sbatch` or `srun`. The login node has 2 cores and 8 GB RAM per user — it's for editing files, not crunching numbers.
2. **Scratch is not backed up.** `$HOME` gets daily backups; `$HOME/scratch` does not. Don't keep anything irreplaceable there.
3. **Scratch auto-deletes after 3 months of inactivity.** Access a file to reset the clock. Or better yet, move finished results off the cluster.
4. **Always pin software versions.** `module load Python` will load whatever is current today — which may not be what it loads in six months. Use `module load Python/3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0`.
5. **`find` and `du` on BeeGFS are slow and rude.** Metadata operations on the shared filesystem affect everyone. Use `lfs find` or cluster-provided tools instead.

## 🔧 Maintaining the wiki

The wiki is designed to grow incrementally. To add new sources:

1. Drop a file (PDF, markdown, plain text) into `wiki/_raw_/`
2. Ask an LLM to ingest it: *"Ingest `wiki/_raw_/<filename>` into the wiki"*
3. The LLM reads `wiki/_schema_/SCHEMA.md`, creates or updates pages in `wiki/_wiki_/`, updates `wiki/index.md`, and appends to `wiki/log.md`

See [wiki/README.md](wiki/README.md) for the full wiki workflow.

## 🤖 LLM skills

`skills/` contains prompt scripts that turn common HPC tasks into guided, interactive workflows when used with an LLM (e.g. Claude Code).

| Skill | Invoke with | What it does |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| [hpc-job](skills/hpc-job/) | *"create a slurm job script"* | Asks 10 questions (partition, time, CPUs, memory, GPU, email…) and writes a ready-to-submit `job.sh` |
| [hpc-module](skills/hpc-module/) | *"find the module for Python"* | Runs `module spider` over SSH and returns the exact `module load` line to paste into your script |
| [hpc-resources](skills/hpc-resources/) | *"tune my job resources"* | Reads `seff` output for a completed job and gives paste-ready `#SBATCH` recommendations for time, CPUs, and memory |

Each skill lives in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` that drives the LLM interaction. To use them, point your LLM at this repo and invoke the skill by name or description.

## 📂 Syncing projects

`sync/` is a small shell tool for keeping a local project folder in sync with the cluster.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
bash sync/install.sh
source ~/.zshrc    # or ~/.bashrc
```

**Register a project (run from your project directory):**
```bash
sync-folder . baobab:~/projects/myproject myproject
```

This creates two shell aliases:
```bash
myproject-up    # rsync local → cluster
myproject-down  # rsync cluster → local
```

The interactive setup also lets you choose extra rsync flags, generate an `rsync-exclude.txt`, and optionally install a cron job for automatic periodic pushes.

See [sync/README.md](sync/README.md) for full documentation.
